# Project Repository

This is a structured and organized repository for your project. It includes directories to separate source code, scripts, documentation, data, and tests. You can add or modify the structure as your project evolves.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Core source code modules and packages.
- **scripts/**: Standalone scripts (e.g., for data processing, training, evaluation) separate from the main package.
- **docs/**: Project documentation, design notes, and specifications.
- **data/**: Input datasets or sample data files. Do not commit large or sensitive data; use a data storage service and reference it here.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for your code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (if you add one).
3. Add your scripts and implementation files in the appropriate directories.
4. Run tests using your preferred test runner (e.g. pytest) to ensure code correctness.

## Version Control and Collaboration

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Create feature branches for new work and open pull requests to merge into the main branch.
- Keep the `main` branch stable and release-ready.
